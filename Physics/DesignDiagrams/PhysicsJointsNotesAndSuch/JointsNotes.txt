//Joint Types that need to be added: 
Prismatic Joint
Cylindrical Joint
Ragdoll Joint (*optional)
Universal Joint
Generic Joint (*specialType optional?)
Revolute Joint
Spherical Joint

//Things to think about
- Rotational Motor - Limit Rotational -> Every Joint?
- Spring Damper -> Every Joint?
- Each has it's own config, have the whole config integrated or certain functions?

-> Rethink when to add joints to the FUDGE System, and when to the PHYSICS System


OIMO Classes/Helpers maybe as properties of the BASE-or-CHILD-JOINT class
> All joints seem to consist out of 2 or 3 of these components:
Spring Damper = dampingRatio, frequency (*optional useSymplecticEuler:Bool)
RotationalLimitMotor
TranslationalLimitMotor  


When and how to create joints, and when not: -> refining
> When Create: 
- The JointComponent has it's attachedRigidbody set(the componentRigidbody) that is on the first object of the connection
- The JointComponent has it's connectedRigidbody set (the componentRigidbody( that is the second object of the connection

> When Destroy:
- When any of the Rigidbodies is deleted -> property is null/undefined/changed -> dirty -> remove joint from world


> Don't:
- When a property is changed that is not any of the RB's itself, that means for change of the anchor/axis the config needs to be recalculated and reapplied to the joint,
not be recreated

> How:
- Create config with all properties from the wrapper class
- add new joint to world
-> have every frame checked for any dirty jointComponent that it can be reconnected?
