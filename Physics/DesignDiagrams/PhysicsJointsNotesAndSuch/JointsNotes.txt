//Joint Types that need to be added: 
Prismatic Joint
Cylindrical Joint
Ragdoll Joint (*optional)
Universal Joint
Generic Joint (*specialType optional?)
Revolute Joint
Spherical Joint

//Things to think about
- Rotational Motor - Limit Rotational -> Every Joint?
- Spring Damper -> Every Joint?
- Each has it's own config, have the whole config integrated or certain functions?

-> Rethink when to add joints to the FUDGE System, and when to the PHYSICS System


OIMO Classes/Helpers maybe as properties of the BASE-or-CHILD-JOINT class
> All joints seem to consist out of 2 or 3 of these components:
Spring Damper = dampingRatio, frequency (*optional useSymplecticEuler:Bool)
